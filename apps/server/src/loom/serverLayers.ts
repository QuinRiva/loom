/**
 * Loom fork-owned server layer bundles.
 *
 * Loom (fork of `pingdotgg/t3code`) adds its own provider sweeps to the server
 * layer graph. To keep `server.ts` mergeable against upstream, those additions
 * live here as named bundles and are spliced into the upstream composition with
 * one `// loom:`-marked line each, rather than scattered `provideMerge` steps.
 *
 * Pull 9 (Phase 1) split this file: the V1-engine bundles (reactors, read lane,
 * provisioner, worktree lock/lease, MCP HTTP routes) are in
 * `quarantine/apps/server/src/loom/serverLayers.ts` (detach ledger DT-24); the
 * provider-layer halves below have no engine dependency and survive.
